## 1. Booting

The process of starting up a computer. This consists of
1. Finding, loading, and running boot code
2. Finding, loading, and running the kernel
3. Running startup script and system daemons
4. Maintaining process hygiene and managing system state transitions

Point (4) continues as long as the system remains up

### 1.1. Firmware

Software that 
- Provides low-level control of computer hardware
- Stored in non-volatile memory, such as ROM

When a computer is powered on, the CPU is hardwired to execute the firmware

---

The firmware knows the devices on the motherboard and allows
- Hardware-level configuration of such devices
- Either expose such devices to the OS or disable and hide them

During normal booting, the firmware 
- Probes for hardware and disks
- Runs a simple set of health checks
- Selects the boot device and loads boot loader

#### 1.1.1. BIOS v. UEFI

BIOS is the traditional firmware

UEFI is the modern standard
- Most UEFI firmware can fall back to a BIOS implementation
- UEFI support is pretty much universal
- But BIOS systems remain in the field

#### 1.1.2. BIOS

BIOS assumes that the boot device starts with the MBR, which includes
- A first-stage boot loader, aka firmware loader (512 bytes)
- A primitive disk-partitioning table

As the first-stage boot loader is less than 512 bytes, it is not sophisticated enough to read any type of filesystem

---

Option 1
1. Reads the disk-partitioning table
2. Identifies the disk partition marked as "active"
3. Executes the second-stage boot loader

Option 2
- The second-stage boot loader can live in the dead zone that lies between the MBR and the beginning of the first disk partition 
- This dead zone contains around 32KB, enough for a filesystem driver

#### 1.1.3. UEFI

This specification
- Includes a modern disk-partitioning scheme, i.e., GPT
- Understands FAT filesystem
- Defines ESP

At boot time, the firmware
1. Looks into the GPT to identify the ESP
2. Reads the boot target
3. Executes it

---

As ESP is just a generic FAT filesystem, the UEFI boot target can be
- A kernel $\rightarrow$ loader-less booting
    - EFI boot stub is an example of firmware loader
- A boot loader

UEFI saves the path to the boot target as a configuration parameter

Although no boot loader at all is technically required, most systems still use one

| `BootOrder: 0000,0001,0002,0004,0003` | The order in which the firmware tries the available boot devices                       |
| `Boot0000` - `Boot0004`               | Available boot devices                                                                 |
| `Boot0004`                            | A GPT partitioned hard drive with the boot loader located at `\EFI\ubuntu\shimx64.efi` |

### 1.2. Boot loader

A computer program that is responsible for booting the kernel

As there may be multiple kernels available, most boot loaders have a boot-time user interface where it is possible to make a choice

A boot loader also takes care of marshalling configuration arguments for the kernel. This arguments can be either hardwired or provided on the fly through the user interface

### 1.3. Kernel

A computer program at the core of an operating system that
- Controls the hardware resources of the computer
- Provides an environment under which programs can run

#### 1.3.1. Kernel parameters

| Parameter        | Meaning                                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `quiet`          | Disable most log messages                                            |
| `debug`          | Enable kernel debugging                                              |
| `init=/bin/bash` | Run `bash` as init process (typically useful for emergency recovery) |
| `root=/dev/foo`  | Tell the kernel where to find the root filesystem (`/`)              |
| `single`         | Boot to single user mode                                             |

#### 1.3.2. Kernel operating modes

| Operating mode | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single-user    | Local filesystems are mounted, a few services are running, and a root shell is started on the console (useful for resolving problems when the system boots but does not function properly or you cannot log into it) |
| Multi-user     | All filesystems are mounted, all configured services are running, along with a graphical user interface                                                                                                              |
| Server         | Similar to multiuser mode, but with no graphical user interface                                                                                                                                                      |

#### 1.3.3. Daemon processes

Processes that lives for a long time. Daemon processes  
- Start when the system is bootstrapped 
- Run in the background (no controlling terminal)
- Terminate only when the system is shut down

Kernel daemons (aka kernel threads or processes)
- Exist for the entire lifetime of the system
- Run with superuser privileges

---

Kernel daemons are part of the kernel itself. This means that
- There is no corresponding program in the filesystem
- They are not configurable
- They do not require administrative attention

In general, each kernel component that 
- Needs to perform work in a process context 
- But that is not invoked from the context of a user-level process 

will usually have its own kernel daemon

---

```shell
$ ps -ef
PID  PPID  TTY   CMD
  1     0    ?   /usr/lib/systemd/systemd
  2     0    ?   [kthreadd]
  3     2    ?   [pool_workqueue_release]
  4     2    ?   [kworker/R-rcu_g]
  
[...]

700     1    ?   /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-logind

[...]
```

---

Anything with `PPID 0` is a kernel daemon started during booting
- `systemd` is the only exception (`PID 1`)

`TTY` identifies the controlling terminal
- `?` means that there is no controlling terminal

Kernel daemons have brackets around their names

`[kthreadd]` is the parent of the other kernel daemons

#### 1.3.4. System management daemon 

The kernel starts the system management daemon with `PID 1`
- Traditionally called `init`
- Nowadays called `systemd` on most Linux distributions

The goal of the system management daemon is to make sure the system runs the right set of services and daemons at any given time

This depends on the mode in which the system should be operating (see [§1.3.2](#132-kernel-operating-modes))

---

Booting $\rightarrow$ multiuser mode
- Set the computer name and time zone
- Check disks and mount filesystems
- Remove old files from `/tmp`
- Configure network interfaces and packet filters
- Startup other daemons and services

The system management daemon has very little knowledge about these tasks, it simply runs a set of commands or scripts that have been designated for execution in that particular order

## 2. System and service management in Linux

`systemd` is the default system daemon for most Linux distributions, which
- Runs with `PID 1`
- Starts the rest of the system

`systemctl` is the command to
- Investigate the status of `systemd`
- Make changes to `systemd` configuration

### 2.1. Units and unit files

A unit is an entity managed by `systemd`

The behavior of each unit is defined in a unit file. These files 
- Are plain text files encoded in ini style
- End with a suffix that identifies the type of unit (e.g., `.service`)

For example, in the case of a service, the unit file tells `systemd`
- The location of the executable file for the service
- How to start and stop the service
- Dependencies, if any

---

`systemd` reads unit files from [several directories](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.unit.html#Unit%20File%20Load%20Path)

| Directory                    | Meaning                                       |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `/usr/lib/systemd/system`    | System units installed by the package manager |
| `/etc/systemd/system`        | System units created by the administrator     |
| `/usr/lib/systemd/user`      | User units installed by the package manager   |
| `/etc/systemd/user`          | User units created by the administrator       |
| `$HOME/.config/systemd/user` | User configuration                            |

Files in `/etc` have the highest priority

---

In addition to the `systemd` system-wide instance, which
- Has `PID 1`
- Controls system units

There are also `systemd` user instances. A user instance
- Is started (stopped) as the user logs in (logs off)
- Controls user units

The system-wide instance is managed by the administrators, while a user instance is managed by either the user or an administrator

---

```shell
$ cat /usr/lib/systemd/system/rsync.service

| `[Service]` | `RestartSec`          | `systemd` waits `1` second before restarting `rsyncd` if it fails |
| `[Service]` | `Restart`             | `systemd` automatically restarts `rsyncd` if it fails             |
| `[Install]` | `WantedBy`            | `systemd` starts `rsyncd` when the system is in multiuser mode    |

`enabled` and `disabled` 
- Apply only to unit files that live in a standard `systemd` directory
- Have an `[Install]` section

`enabled` means that
- The directives in the `[Install]`have been executed
- The unit will start on boot

`static` is for those units that do not have an `[Install]` section

As a rule of thumb
- Avoid `linked` unit files $\rightarrow$ just make copies
- Use `systemctl disable` to turn off `enabled` units
- Use `systemctl mask` to turn off `static` units

#### 2.2.3. Showing unit statuses

`status` shows runtime status information

```shell
$ systemctl status rsync.service
○ rsync.service - fast remote file copy program daemon
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/rsync.service; disabled; preset: enabled)
     Active: inactive (dead)
       Docs: man:rsync(1)
             man:rsyncd.conf(5)
```

- The unit file of `rsync.service` was properly loaded into memory (`loaded`)
- The service does not start on boot (`disabled`), although the default setting is to start it on boot (`preset: enabled`)
- The service is not running right now (`Active: inactive (dead)`)

```shell
$ systemctl status systemd-journald.service -l

#### 2.2.4. Switching between targets

`get-default` shows the target the system boots into by default

```shell
$ systemctl get-default
graphical.target
```

| Operating mode | Target                                                                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single-user    | `rescue.target`                                                                                               |
| Multi-user     | `graphical.target`, which includes everything included in `multi-user.target` plus a graphical user interface |
| Server         | `multi-user.target`                                                                                           |

---

There are also other targets, such as
- `poweroff.target` that halts the system
- `reboot.target` that reboots the system

`isolate` changes operating mode to a given target

```shell
$ sudo systemctl isolate reboot.target
Connection to admin.unife.edu closed by remote host.
Connection to admin.unife.edu closed.
```

### 2.3. Dependencies among units

Runtime dependencies define how units behave at runtime, i.e., when `systemd` starts or stops them

| Directive  | Section  | Type    | Meaning                                                                                              |
| ---------- | -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Wants`    | `[Unit]` | Runtime | The wanted unit starts if available, but failure does not stop the main unit (optional dependencies) |
| `Requires` | `[Unit]` | Runtime | If a required unit fails or stops, the main unit also stops (critical dependencies)                  |

---

Install-time dependencies define what happens when  `systemd` enables them

| Directive    | Section     | Type         | Meaning                                                    |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `WantedBy`   | `[Install]` | Install-time | The main unit starts even if wanted units are missing      |
| `RequiredBy` | `[Install]` | Install-time | The main unit fails to start if a required unit is missing |

---

```shell
$ cat /usr/lib/systemd/system/rsync.service

[...]

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

When the system boots in `multi-user.target`, `rsync.service` is started. If `rsync.service` fails (the wanted unit), `multi-user.target` starts anyway (the main unit). In other words, the system still boots in multi-user mode if `rsync` fails. Put yet another way, `rsync` is an optional dependency of `multi-user.target`

### 2.4. Execution order

Do **not** assume that if `A Requires B`, then `A` is started before `B`

When the system transitions to a new state, `systemd`
1. Identify the units that will be affected
2. Uses `Before` and `After` directives in `[Unit]` to sort the work
    1. Units with no `Before/After` are adjusted in parallel
